        <a name="SoaC">Structure of a Client.</a>
      </h3>
      <p class="overview_content"> All client programs have several required functional components. Each of these components exists in all clients and all have well-defined purposes. </p>
      <h4 class="overview_title">
        <a name="SoaC_TCC">The Command Queue.</a>
      </h4>
      <p class="overview_content"> The <a href="command-queue.html" class="general_link">command queue</a> is a <i>passive</i> list of command objects created by the client program. This queue is a holding area for commands initialized by the client that are waiting to be sent. Pending commands are held here to allow the client to change options, to send a command more than once, or to hold onto it until a certain point in time. Commands in the queue are <i>never</i> sent without an explicit "send" call from the client. Commands stay in the queue, even after they're sent, until the client removes them. The command's execution status (at the terminal location) will be retained for retrieval by the client depending on the type of "send" call, but the immediate return of a "send" call will only return a reference number to be used to retrieve that status (i.e. the initial return <i>only</i> indicates a successful or failed "send".) </p>
      <h4 class="overview_title">
        <a name="SoaC_TMC">The Message Queue.</a>
      </h4>
      <p class="overview_content"> The <a href="message-queue.html" class="general_link">message queue</a> is an <i>active</i> list of incoming messages received from the server. It has two components: </p>
      <ul class="other_bullet_list">
        <li class="overview_content">
          <b>Message List.</b> The message list holds all incoming messages until the client removes them. Each message contains source and destination information as well as text, binary, or command content. The information in each message's content section isn't standardized to allow for diverse implementations. <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li class="overview_content">
          <b>Message Queue Thread.</b> The term "message queue" is generally used to mean the thread running in the background used to monitor IPC from the server. This thread receives <i>all</i> incoming data, regardless of if a message is registered in the message list. This thread must be running before any communication with the server can take place, even outgoing commands. <br />
          <br />
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="overview_content"> In some cases, the message queue thread can be merged with the main thread of the program. This isn't reversible, but can simplify the structure of the client program. See the <a href="message-queue.html" class="general_link">message queue</a> section for more information. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> All received commands pass through the message queue regardless of if they originate from other clients or the server itself. The server filters all commands from other clients, so all commands actually arriving at any given client will be received directly from its server. </p>
      <h4 class="overview_title">
        <a name="SoaC_MCT">Main Client Thread.</a>
      </h4>
      <p class="overview_content"> The main client thread is the "thread of control" of the client program. This is generally the thread that <span class="style_inline_code">main</span> runs in and should be used to initialize the client. Normally this thread contains the "loop" process used to carry out the functions of the client. This thread should monitor the status of the message queue and exit if the message queue exits. See the <a href="message-queue.html" class="general_link">message queue</a> section for more information. </p>
      <h4 class="overview_title">
        <a name="SoaC_TOCPG">The Original Client Process Group.</a>
      </h4>
      <p class="overview_content"> In addition to monitoring IPC channels, the server will monitor the original process group it created with the client. When the server starts a new process to turn into a client, that process' ID becomes the ID of its process group. Normally all subsequent forks will share that same process group. The server will consider a client to be "exited" if all processes in that group cease to exist. This can happen, for example, if a client forks and creates a new session or a new process group, allowing the original process to exit. Otherwise, this merely means that when the client process itself has exited, the server no longer holds references to it. </p>
      <h4 class="overview_title">
        <a name="SoaC_CFUbC">Command Formats Used by Clients.</a>
      </h4>
      <p class="overview_content"> Resourcerver clients use two separate command formats via the C/C++ API. Most commands are queued in the command queue and must be sent manually. The functions generating queued commands return a <span class="style_inline_code">command_handle</span>, which is used to reference that particular instance for changing the command's options and for sending it. Other more important commands that don't allow options have API functions that pseudo-atomically send the command at the time it's created and wait for a response. Those commands return some indicator of outcome, such as <span class="style_inline_code">result</span> or <span class="style_inline_code">command_event</span>. The message queue must be running to send using either format. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> Queued commands are <i>never</i> sent to the server without the client program explicitly sending them. The "send" functions never wait for the outcome. The outcome of a sent command is only available through callback functions registered when the command is sent and/or if the command was sent in a manner that monitors the status of the command. </p>
      <p>
      <p class="overview_content"> Pseudo-atomic commands will make the calling thread appear to freeze until an outcome is received. The status returned is generally the <i>final</i> outcome of the command and no future status changes will become available. Sometimes the command will time out, but a command that's sent cannot be unsent, so the command might still be executed later on. Normally this <i>won't</i> happen, but if it does, the final status won't be available. </p>

        <a name="CI">Client Initialization.</a>
      </h3>
      <p class="overview_content"> All clients must be initialized and registered before they can function as clients. Before proper initialization, consider the functions below. </p>
      <div align="center">
        <pre class="example_box code_box header_box">
<b><u>#include &lt;rservr/api/log-output.h&gt;</u></b>

<i>//call this as soon as the program starts</i>
<b>result set_program_name(text_info);</b>

<i>//call as soon as the log file is known (if changing from that of the server)</i>
<b>result set_log_file(text_info);</b>
<b>result set_log_fd(int);</b>

<i>//use this to manually set the client's name if registering an unnamed client</i>
<b>result set_log_client_name(text_info);</b>
</pre>
      </div>
      <p class="overview_content"> The <span class="style_inline_code">set_program_name</span> function is only used to set the program label in log output. This is useful for searching the log based on program name. Normally this will be set to <span class="style_inline_code">argv[0]</span>. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> The <span class="style_inline_code">set_log_file</span> function is almost never necessary because clients generally inherit their log file from the server. This function should be called immediately upon determining an alternate log file name if there actually is one. Most client's won't use this function. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> <i>All</i> clients must call the function below as their first formal operation as a client. This function performs several actions such as registering signal handlers, loading the table of commands, and compiling the timing table. </p>
      <div align="center">
        <pre class="example_box code_box header_box">
<b><u>#include &lt;rservr/api/client.h&gt;</u></b>

<i>//initialize the internals of a client</i>
<b>result initialize_client();</b>
</pre>
      </div>
      <p class="overview_content"> The message queue <i>cannot</i> be running when <span class="style_inline_code">initialize_client</span> is called. This is due to a security restriction intended to prevent plug-in commands from loading <i>additional</i> commands when they're executed by a client. The client program should <i>always</i> exit immediately if this function fails. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> Once the client is initialized, the rest of the client should be set up according to its purpose. Everything that needs to be set up <i>prior</i> to the client communicating with the server and other clients should be done before going on to the next step. </p>
      <p>

      <h3 class="overview_title">
        <a name="CR">Client Registration.</a>
      </h3>
      <p class="overview_content"> All clients must be registered after they're initialized. The message queue must be running before registering using <a href="message-queue.html#RtMQ_NOotMQ" class="style_inline_code general_link">start_message_queue</a>. Once the message queue is running, call <i>one</i> of the registration functions below to register the client. All of the registration functions are pseudo-atomic, so they won't return until the outcome of the registration request is final. Client programs should exit if registration fails. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> A single argument used in a registration function denotes the name to be used to reference that client. This name must be unique among all current client and service names, and they can't be the same name as the server. Monitor clients <i>may not</i> register with a name and resource clients have the option to register without a name, but all other clients <i>require</i> a valid name. Client names must match the pattern given in the <a href="command-queue.html#CCaAL" class="general_link">label-checking</a> section. </p>
      <div align="center">
        <pre class="example_box code_box header_box">

<b><u>#include &lt;rservr/api/resource-client.h&gt;</u></b>

<i>//register a resource client</i>
<b>result register_resource_client(text_info);</b>
</pre>
      </div>
      <p class="overview_content"> Everything following the registration of the client is considered the execution of the client. This normally consists of either a loop or passing control to a GUI. The client should <i>always</i> check the status of the message queue before the start of each iteration of a loop and exit if it's no longer running: that's normally an indication that the client was disconnected from the server. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> Normally a client doesn't need to deregister before exiting, but it's "good form" to do so. Deregistration is also useful when you'd like to change a client's type after it's already registered (which is a <i>non-standard</i>, but allowed, operation.) Client types <i>cannot</i> be changed <i>without</i> deregistering first. Deregistration automatically removes all <a href="services.html" class="general_link">services</a> associated with resource clients and effectively makes the client "disappear" from the visibility of all other clients. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> The <span class="style_command_line">register_all_wait</span> <span class="style_command_line">rservr</span> configuration option will cause the original <span class="style_command_line">rservr</span> process to wait for all clients to register with the server before it exits (leaving the actual server running as a forked daemon at that time.) Normally a client's status is implicitly updated when it registers with the server using one of the functions previously described in this section. Programs such as <span class="style_command_line">rservrd</span> need to register <i>before</i> they're actually ready, and then perform setup based on information received after successful registration. In <span class="style_command_line">rservrd</span>'s case, it requires the name of its server to add it to the table of servers. Use the functions below to manually indicate that the client is ready for interaction. </p>
      <div align="center">
        <pre class="example_box code_box header_box">
<b><u>#include &lt;rservr/api/client.h&gt;</u></b>

<i>//use this function to disable automatic readiness indication</i>
<b>void disable_indicate_ready();</b>
<i>//this must be called <u>before</u> registering the client</i>

<i>//use this function to indicate to the server that the client is ready</i>
<b>result manual_indicate_ready();</b>
<i>//this must be called <u>after</u> registering the client</i>
</pre>
      </div>
      <p class="overview_content"> The functions above are <i>single-use only</i>. These functions will effect notification of both <span class="style_command_line">rservr</span> (during the configuration stage) and the admin client starting a client (such as <span class="style_command_line">rservrd</span> when using the <span class="style_command_line">r</span> daemon option.) </p>
