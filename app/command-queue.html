        <a name="ICP">Individual Command Permissions.</a>
      </h3>
      <p class="overview_content"> All commands have 3 sets of permissions, plus possible transmission restrictions.  All of these restrictions are security related and allow client types to be well defined. </p>
      <h4 class="overview_title">
        <a name="ICP_CCP">Command Creation Permissions.</a>
      </h4>
      <p class="overview_content"> All built-in commands created by clients have a pair of type specifications used to determine if a client can actually create them for sending.  The first specification denotes the required type flags the client must have.  The second denotes the type flags the client <i>must not</i> have.  Together they define a set of client types that can create and send the command. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> All plug-in commands have a single type specification used to define the type flags a client must have <i>one or more of</i> to create a command. Plug-in commands don't have a second specification denoting "must not" types as built-in commands do. Unlike built-in command permissions, the client need only have <i>one</i> of the flags required (as opposed to <i>all</i> required, as with built-in commands). </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> Within the Resourcerver API, creation permissions are generally tied with the specific header that's used to create a command.  For example, all commands in <span class="style_inline_code">&lt;rservr/api/service-client.h&gt;</span> can be created, sent, and parsed by service clients.  Most built-in commands are aranged in this manner, but most of the included plug-in commands have individual requirements for each command. See the <a href="plugin-table.html" class="general_link">plug-in table</a> for information about specific plug-in commands. </p>
      <h4 class="overview_title">
        <a name="ICP_CPP">Command Parse Permissions.</a>
      </h4>
      <p class="overview_content"> All commands have type specifications, used in the same manner as command creation specifications, to determine if a client can parse an incoming command.  Once the header of the incoming command is received and the command name is known, each client will check its command table to determine if it meets that commandâ€™s parsing requirements before parsing the content of the command. </p>
      <h4 class="overview_title">
        <a name="ICP_CEP">Command Execution Permissions.</a>
      </h4>
      <p class="overview_content"> All commands have a single type specification denoting the type flags required to execute the command.  This is often more restrictive than the parse permissions to allow other types of client to parse and forward the command without executing it. </p>
      <h4 class="overview_title">
        <a name="ICP_AR">Additional Restrictions.</a>
      </h4>
      <p class="overview_content"> Some commands cannot be sent outside of the current Resourcerver system due to the nature of their execution.  For example, it makes no sense to send a client registration command or terminal request command outside of the local system because neither will work.  These commands are generally sent pseudo-atomically, but some are placed on the command queue with addressing restrictions. </p>

        <a name="ATA">Adding Target Addresses.</a>
      </h3>
      <p class="overview_content"> Clients can address commands to remote clients or servers using the functions listed here. Commands sent to remote systems must pass through the local server to a forwarder client which is also registered on the local server. That forwarder will then forward the command to the address specified within the command, which will be received by a corresponding forwarder in another system. Addressing therefore requires pairs consisting of a single forwarder name and a single address specification. The address specification format is determined by the forwarder, but it's normally the name of a local socket or of an IP address. See the <a href="../user/socket-forward.html" class="general_link">standard command forwarder</a> documentation for more information about addressing. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> A set of forwarder and address pairs is called a "scope." To insert a target scope at the beginning of the existing command's target, use the function below. This added scope will precede all previously-added scopes and will be the first destination of the command once it's sent. </p>
      <div align="center">
        <pre class="example_box code_box header_box">
<b><u>#include &lt;rservr/api/command-queue.h&gt;</u></b>

<i>//provide the command's handle and the scope of the remote target</i>
<b>result add_remote_address(command_handle, text_info);</b>
</pre>
      </div>
      <p class="overview_content"> The address used above must consist only of complete forwarder and address pairs. The forwarder and address components are separated by a single "<b>?</b>", as in "<span class="style_address">client?address</span>". Each pair is separated by a single "<b>|</b>", as in "<span class="style_address">client1?address1|client2?address2</span>". </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> Subsequent calls to this function will insert the new scopes before those previously inserted. Inserting scopes in front of those already existing allows server commands (such as service registration commands) to be sent to remote servers. This also has the effect of displacing the initial target client's name, so the target used when creating a command will always be the terminal entity of the command. Clients should therefore use the name of the terminal entity when creating a command, then add address scopes if necessary to reach that target's server. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> Addresses are executed in left-to-right order. Using the example address above (assuming the command was created using "<span class="style_address">target</span>" as its target,) the command will first be sent to <span class="style_address">client1</span> on the local server, which will forward the command over its connection <span class="style_address">address1</span> to a connected forwarder and subsequently to <span class="style_address">client2</span> via that forwarder's server, which will then forward the command over its connection <span class="style_address">address2</span> to a connected forwarder, and once in that forwarder's Resourcerver system the command will be sent to "<span class="style_address">target</span>". Notice that the actual name of the forwarder connected on the opposite end of a connection <i>doesn't matter</i> (and generally isn't available) for the purposes of addressing. </p>

While priority is always limited by the client's current priority restrictions, you can always request an extremely low priority value. Priority values range from 0 to 255, the lower values indicating a higher priority, with a default minimum value of 127. This default value is the absolute minimum allowed by the server unless it's changed within the server's configuration before the client is started. The default value <i>attempted</i> by all commands is 0, so only change the priority if you're willing to place the command behind others. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> While it might seem that the actual usefulness of a command's priority is limited to whether or not it's greater than another, that's far from the truth. The server uses an algorithm to determine the order in which to execute commands that involves moving older commands up in the wait list incrementally based both on how long they've been waiting and on their priorities. In other words, if commands with a priority of 127 constantly arrive in the server's queue, a command arriving with a priority higher than that <i>won't</i> be bumped out of the way indefinitely. In that particular case, though, the command would get through a lot faster with a priority of 128 than with one of 255. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> Use the function below to change the priority of a command before sending it: </p>
      <div align="center">
        <pre class="example_box code_box header_box">
<b><u>#include &lt;rservr/api/command-queue.h&gt;</u></b>

<i>//provide the command's handle and the new priority</i>
<b>result change_command_priority(command_handle, command_priority);</b>
</pre>
      </div>
      <p class="overview_content"> The function above can be used regardless of other restrictions placed on a command. This includes changing the priority of commands to be forwarded outside of the current Resourcerver system. If you're developing a command forwarder, there's no need to set the priority of commands to be forwarded to 0 before sending them. </p>

      </h3>
      <p class="overview_content"> Responses are a very limited type of client command. They require a message to be received in the message queue from another client, and that message must be visible to the client program at the time the response is created. Use the functions below to create responses. See the <a href="message-queue.html" class="general_link">message queue</a> section for information about retrieving messages. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> You will need to cast messages with <span class="style_inline_code">RSERVR_RESPOND</span> to use them with the response API. This provides additional run-time protection while allowing things like <span class="style_inline_code">set_async_response</span> to work. </p>

<b><u>#include &lt;rservr/api/client.h&gt;</u></b>

<i>/* the commands below are "bypass" commands which allows them to bypass normal response
   permissions. this allows a client to briefly respond to clients it wouldn't normally

   responses to indicate the status of a request. data will be truncated if it exceeds
   this length. */</i>
</pre>

      <p class="overview_content"> The responses above create a command in the command queue which must be sent and deallocated. You can't add or change the target or address of a response, but you can change its priority. A response uses the priority of the command it's in response to by default. The simple commands above should only be used for short responses with trivial data. </p>
