        <a name="IFC">IPC Forwarding Clients.</a>
      </h3>
      <p class="overview_content"> IPC forwarders are client programs that attach to an <span class="style_command_line">rservr</span> and connect directly to a client of the same type running on another <span class="style_command_line">rservr</span>. These clients forward IPC commands between the two systems, allowing both systems to utilize the resources of the other. Each system retains independece from all other systems, but the connections allow clients on one system to perform actions on the server of the other system or to communicate with clients on the other server. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> Most IPC forwarders used will be the standard forwarders included in the Resourcerver package. These forwarders are highly-configurable and can make local or network connections. More information can be found in the <a href="socket-forward.html" class="general_link"><span class="style_command_line">rsv-fs<span style="font-weight:normal;">*</span></span> and <span class="style_command_line">rsv-net<span style="font-weight:normal;">*</span></span> Program Guide</a> section. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> The sole purpose of each forwarder is to provide a communication point between two systems. Other clients in the system will send commands to the other system by addressing them to the forwarding client, along with a formatted address specification used by the forwarder to determine which of its connections to send the command over (e.g. an IP address.) </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> Forwarders generally ignore the entire content of the command and only interpret the address given to determine where the command should be forwarded to. The socket-forwarding clients can utilize security plug-ins to control the actual connections between the two systems to provide various types of network security. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> The primary reason for having forwarders is to allow applications to spread across networks. A client running on a local <span class="style_command_line">rservr</span> can normally be relocated across a network by starting a new <span class="style_command_line">rservr</span> at the remote location with that client connected, then having both systems connect to each other using network socket-forwarder clients. Resource clients can easily be designed to have remote-system awareness, allowing them to register their own services on remote servers. This allows clients on the remote system to use those services as if they were local to their own <span class="style_command_line">rservr</span>. </p>

        <a name="SF">Standard Forwarders.</a>
      </h3>
      <p class="overview_content"> The Resourcerver package contains a set of standard forwarder clients to cover nearly all command-forwarding requirements. </p>
      <h4 class="overview_title">
        <a name="SF_PF">Pipe Forwarders.</a>
      </h4>
      <p class="overview_content"> The pipe forwarders <span class="style_command_line">rsv-relay</span> and <span class="style_command_line">rsv-controller</span> are normally used for debugging command forwarding within a specific application. They both receive from standard input and forward to standard output. They normally need to be started with the <span class="style_command_line">pipexec</span> program with a set of named pipes. These forwarders connect to exactly one other forwarder and do not use sockets or network connections. See the <a href="package.html" class="general_link">Core Package Contents</a> section for more information about using these programs. </p>
      <h4 class="overview_title">
        <a name="SF_SF">Socket Forwarders.</a>
      </h4>
      <p class="overview_content"> The socket forwarders <span class="style_command_line">rsv-fsrelay</span>, <span class="style_command_line">rsv-fscontroller</span>, <span class="style_command_line">rsv-netrelay</span>, and <span class="style_command_line">rsv-netcontroller</span> forward commands over sockets. These forwarders can all listen to sockets and accept connections, and can also connect to sockets that other forwarders are listening to. They can connect to an arbitrary number of other sockets, based on the limitations of the system. They differ from the pipe forwarders in configurability and from each other in methods of addressing. Those containing <span class="style_command_line">fs</span> in the name deal with local sockets bound to the file system. Those containing <span class="style_command_line">net</span> in the name deal with network sockets and ports. See the <a href="socket-forward.html" class="general_link"><span class="style_command_line">rsv-fs<span style="font-weight:normal;">*</span></span> and <span class="style_command_line">rsv-net<span style="font-weight:normal;">*</span></span> Program Guide</a> section for more information. </p>
      <h4 class="overview_title">
        <a name="SF_RF">Relay Forwarders.</a>
      </h4>
      <p class="overview_content"> All relay forwarders (forwarders ending with <span class="style_command_line">relay</span>) are resource clients. All of the relay forwarders will register anonymously (without a name) and will register a service using the name provided on the command line. The service's type will correspond to the last part of the programs name, e.g. <span class="style_command_line">fsrelay</span>. This prevents non-service clients from utilizing the connection. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> All relay forwarders utilize the <span class="style_file_name">librsvp-rqsrvc-auto.so</span> command plug-in. The <span class="style_file_name">librsvp-rqsrvc.so</span> command plug-in provides the core commands for remotely requesting a client register its services on the local server, and <span class="style_file_name">librsvp-rqsrvc-auto.so</span> automates this process. This allows client programs to contact a relay forwarder remotely (using <span class="style_file_name">librsvp-rqsrvc.so</span>) and request it register its services locally, and that relay will register a forwarding service on the requesting client's server. The resulting service will allow local clients to forward commands across the relay's connection as if that relay were connected locally. This effectively serves as a local "shortcut" for an address, allowing lengthy addresses to be replaced by a single service name. </p>
      <h4 class="overview_title">
        <a name="SF_CF">Controller Forwarders.</a>
      </h4>
      <p class="overview_content"> All controller forwarders (forwarders ending with <span class="style_command_line">controller</span>) are control clients. Unlike relay forwarders, they do not register services. Controller forwarders aren't accesible by resource clients except when responding to another control client that sent a request via that controller forwarder. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> Controller forwarders are normally only used to relocate single control clients to remote systems. All addressing using controller forwarders must be explicit (i.e. no shortcuts using remote services.) Most requirements can use relay forwarders instead since control clients normally won't need to contact other control clients on remote Resourcerver systems. </p>
      <h4 class="overview_title">
        <a name="SF_PiSF">Plug-in Security Filters.</a>
      </h4>
      <p class="overview_content"> The standard socket forwarders optionally utilize security filter plug-ins. These plug-ins control connections between forwarders using IP filtering, connection authentication, encryption and decryption, and custom send and receive functions. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> Each specific plug-in defines behavior for each of the above types of security control as applicable. Not all plug-ins will utilize all of the above control aspects. Individual forwarder instances can utilize multiple filters at once, but normally all forwarders wishing to connect to it must have the same plug-ins loaded and in the same order. </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> The Resourcerver package provides a few generic plug-ins for testing purposes. Most non-trivial plug-ins will take a parameter string upon loading to configure itself, but the actual format and semantics of that string is entirely up to the designer of the plug-in. See the <a href="package.html" class="general_link">Core Package Contents</a> section for information about the included plug-ins. </p>
