      </h3>
      <p class="overview_content"> The forwarders outlined in this guide fall into two distinct categories: one type uses a network addressing format, the other uses a file-system addressing format. This should be intuitive to anyone who's used network addressing (with ports) and a Unix file system, but these forwarders extend both slightly. </p>
      <ul class="other_bullet_list">
        <li class="overview_content">
          <b>Network Addressing.</b> The network forwarders use the standard <span class="style_address">hostname:port</span> format.  Either a hostname or an IP address may be used, but the address is tracked internally based on IP address; therefore, they should be interchangeable once a connection is made.  All connections <i>must</i> be initiated using <i>both</i> a host and a port number. The initiating end will record the full address (IP address and port number); therefore, <i>both</i> must be used when targeting a connection from the initiating end.  Incoming connections on listening sockets are recorded with the incoming IP address <i>without</i> any port number; therefore, <i>no</i> port number may be used when targeting a connection from the listening end. Multiple connections to the same location (as determined by the retained information) will be differentiated internally by appending "<b>/</b>" plus a numerical identifier.  This can be used to explicitly address a certain connection; however, if it isn't used to indicate a specific connection then the first match will be used. For example, two separate clients from a single remote machine might connect to the same forwarder located at <span class="style_address">192.168.2.1:2048</span>, but the receiving forwarder can't differentiate between the two clients; therefore, it will record the connections as <span class="style_address">192.168.2.1/1</span> and <span class="style_address">192.168.2.1/2</span>, based on the order they're connected in.  Requests passed through that forwarder may be addressed to merely <span class="style_address">192.168.2.1</span>, which would result in the command being passed to the first connection made, or explicitly to one of the two by appending <span class="style_address">/1</span> or <span class="style_address">/2</span>. These numerical identifiers may be arbitrarily included in or excluded from any address specification. <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li class="overview_content">
          <b>File-system Addressing.</b> Socket files are limited to the same <a class="general_link" href="introduction.html#NR">naming restrictions</a> as all other components used in a Resourcerver system.  Additionally, they <i>may not</i> contain the character "<b>;</b>", which is used to differentiate between multiple connections to the same location. As with "<b>/</b>" for network addressing, "<b>;</b>" is followed by a numerical identifier which may be used to target specific connections, or it may left out to default to the first matching connection.  Unlike network addressing, no relevant information is available for the initiating end (because it's from the same machine); therefore, connections received from listening sockets will be recorded with a hexadecimal serial number to differentiate between the different connections. For example, one forwarder might listen to a socket at <span class="style_file_name">/tmp/relay2in</span>, and another forwarder might connect to it. The connecting forwarder would record a connection to "<b>/tmp/relay2in;1</b>" (with "<b>;1</b>" denoting its first connection to that address) and the listening forwarder would record an address such as "<b>0x8069ee0</b>" to differentiate it from all other incoming connections; unlike network addressing, no information is provided to the forwarder about the incoming connection. <br />
          <br />
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="overview_content"> While address-scope assembly is built into the protocol of Resourcerver, this guide is an appropriate place to discuss it a little further.  When addressing a command to a target, the command will hold both a target name and an address name.  The address name will <i>always</i> have complete pairs of targets and addresses for remote targeting, to include zero complete pairs for a local command.  The combination of the initial target and the address indicates the final target of the command.  For example, a command might target "<b>client1</b>" and have an address of "<b>client2?localhost:2048</b>". The command would initially be sent to "<b>client1</b>" on the local system, which is presumably a socket-forwarder.  If not, the send operation would probably result in an error. Assuming that "<b>client1</b>" is a socket-forwarder, it would check to see if it has a connection to "<b>localhost:2048</b>", and if so, would forward the command across that connection.  Lastly, the receiving end, also a socket-forwarder, would send the command through its local Resourcerver system to "<b>client2</b>". </p>
      <p class="overview_content"> The most difficult part to understand about addressing is how and why target addresses are represented differently internally than how they're specified within a program (this is more of an issue for developers.)  For example, you might specify that a command should be sent to "<b>client1?localhost:2048</b>" before sending to the initial target of "<b>client2</b>", which was probably the target used to initialize the command object, yet internally it becomes "<b>client1</b>" and "<b>client2?localhost:2048</b>", as given in the above example. This transformation from in-order to reverse-ordered client/address pairs is essential to making sure addressing isn't corrupted, but other than that, the internal representations are generally only seen when listing remote services. For this reason, It's generally alright to ignore the actual addressing shown for remote services. </p>
