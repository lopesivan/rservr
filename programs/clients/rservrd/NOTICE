**************************************************
~~WARNING:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'rservrd'  MUST be  owned by  rservrd:rservrd with
the setuid and setgid flags set, otherwise it will
not function correctly (or maybe even at all.) The
included build/install  system could not make this
happen, so the super-user  on this system needs to
make sure both the user and the group exist,  make
sure 'rservrd' is owned by both,  and set the file
permissions  of the  executable to  something like
6755.   The program  will  provide  an  additional
warning if you forget.

This   program  requires   setuid   abilities  for
security  and to provide  a more  reliable  access
system.
